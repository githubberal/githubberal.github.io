<h2>Tiddly Winks</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time there was a little girl named Tiddly Winks.  Now, Tiddly Winks was a nice little girl.  She did have one habit that sometimes caught people by surprise:  She linked to wink.  A lot.  Tiddly Winks winked when she saw you in the morning and said, "Hi!"  Tiddly Winks winked when she smiled at you.  Tiddly Winks winked when she was sad and crying. Tiddly Winks winked when she was scared.  Tiddly Winks winked when she was hungry.  Tiddly Winks winked when she was tired and yawning.  In fact, Tiddly Winks winked for just about any thing at all
</p>

  One day Tiddly Winks was happily winking her way down the street.
