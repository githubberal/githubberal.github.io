<h2>Plot Synopsis:</h2>

<p>
  Dominick &quot;Dom&quot; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are &quot;extractors&quot;, who perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract information while experiencing shared dreaming. Their latest target is Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe). The extraction from Saito fails because of the memory of Cobb&#39;s wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). Saito reveals that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of &quot;inception&quot;: planting an idea in a person&#39;s subconscious.
</p>

<p>
To break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer (Pete Postlethwaite), Saito wants Cobb to cause Fischer&#39;s son and heir, Robert (Cillian Murphy) to dissolve his father&#39;s company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb&#39;s murder charge, allowing Cobb to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and sets about assembling his team: Eames (Tom Hardy), a conman and identity forger; Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who concocts a powerful sedative for a stable &quot;dream within a dream&quot; strategy; Ariadne (Ellen Page), an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb&#39;s father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles (Michael Caine). Saito accompanies the team to verify their success. When Ariadne shares a dream with Cobb, she learns that his subconscious recreates Mal, and she appears frequently in his dreams as a hostile force.
</p>

<p>
When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a flight back to Los Angeles, which the team uses as an opportunity to approach him. Cobb sedates and brings Fischer into a shared dream with the extractors. At each level in the layered dreaming, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a &quot;kick&quot; that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members who have entered another dream layer deeper. The plan is for Yusuf to drive off a bridge in the <em>first</em> dream layer, Arthur to use the elevator in the <em>second</em> layer, and someone to create an explosion in the <em>third</em> layer simultaneously. While death in a dream would normally cause the dreamer to wake up, the sedatives used to stabilize the dreams would not allow that. Thus, death during the mission will result in entering &quot;Limbo&quot;, an expanse of infinite raw subconscious from which it is very difficult to escape.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>first</strong> dream layer, the team enter Yusuf&#39;s dream of a rainy Los Angeles. The team abducts Fischer, but he subconsciously creates a team of bodyguards who wound Saito. Eames impersonates Fischer&#39;s godfather, Peter Browning (Tom Berenger), to suggest Fischer reconsider his father&#39;s will. Yusuf drives the van, pursued by the bodyguards, as the rest (including Fischer) are sedated into the second level.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the <strong>second</strong> layer, a hotel dreamed by Arthur, Cobb convinces Fischer that he is kidnapped by Browning and that Cobb is his subconscious protector. Cobb persuades him to go down another level to explore Browning&#39;s subconscious (whereas it is actually a ruse to enter Fischer&#39;s).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <strong>third</strong> layer is a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Cobb takes Fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Yusuf, under pursuit in the first layer, accidentally drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon. This removes the gravity of Arthur&#39;s dream world and causes an avalanche in Eames&#39; dream. Arthur is forced to improvise a new kick that will synchronize with the van hitting the water. Cobb&#39;s projection of Mal kills Fischer, and Saito succumbs to his wounds; both fall into Limbo.<a href="#13">[13]</a> <a id="While">While</a> Eames sets up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives, Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to find Fischer and Saito.
</p>

<p>
Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. There, they spent fifty years constructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to leave Limbo, Cobb implanted in her mind the idea that the world wasn&#39;t <em>real</em>, using a rudimentary form of Inception. As she woke up from the dream, Mal was still convinced that it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> the real world. In an attempt to &quot;wake up&quot; for real, Mal committed suicide, and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles.
</p>

<p>
Through his confession, Cobb attains catharsis, makes peace with his subconscious&#39;s creation of Mal and remains in Limbo to search for Saito. Ariadne finds Fischer and wakes him up with a kick. Fischer is revived at the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a vision of his father telling him to be his own man. All team members other than Cobb and Saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony in Limbo, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team&#39;s sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in Yusuf&#39;s dream hits the water. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo, reminding him of the agreement. The two wake up on the airplane, where the entire team and Robert Fischer have awakened.
