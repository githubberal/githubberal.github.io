  <li>1 tablespoon garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 pound pasta, cooked al dente
    <ul>
        <li>The traditional noodle is spaghetti, but linguini also works.</li>

    </ul></li>
    <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Salt and fresh black pepper to taste</li>
