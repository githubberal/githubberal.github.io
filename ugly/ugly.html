<h1>Poems by Lewis Carrol</h1>

<h2>Jabberwocky</h2>

<p>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
</p>

<p id ="para1">'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
The frumious Bandersnatch!'<br>
</p>

<p>
He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br>
Long time the manxome foe he sought --<br>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>
And stood a while in thought.<br>
</p>

<p>
And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
And burbled as it came!<br>
</p>

<p>
One two! One two! And through and through<br>
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
He left it dead, and with its head<br>
He went galumphing back.<br>
</p>

<p>
'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br>
He chortled in his joy.<br>
</p>

<p>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
</p>


<h2>The Walrus and the Carpenter</h2>

<p>
The sun was shining on the sea,<br>
Shining with all his might:<br>
He did his very best to make<br>
The billows smooth and bright --<br>
And this was odd, because it was<br>
The middle of the night.<br>
</p>

<p>
The moon was shining sulkily,<br>
Because she thought the sun<br>
Had got no business to be there<br>
After the day was done --<br>
'It's very rude of him.' she said,<br>
'To come and spoil the fun!'<br>
</p>

<p>
The sea was wet as wet could be,<br>
The sands were dry as dry.<br>
You could not see a cloud, because<br>
No cloud was in the sky:<br>
No birds were flying overhead --<br>
There were no birds to fly.<br>
</p>

<p>
The Walrus and the Carpenter<br>
Were walking close at hand:<br>
They wept like anything to see<br>
Such quantities of sand:<br>
'If this were only cleared away,'<br>
They said, 'it would be grand.'<br>
</p>

<p>
'If seven maids with seven mops<br>
Swept it for half a year,<br>
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,<br>
'That they could get it clear?'<br>
'l doubt it,' said the Carpenter,<br>
And shed a bitter tear.<br>
</p>

<p>
'O Oysters, come and walk with us!<br>
The Walrus did beseech.<br>
'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br>
Along the briny beach:<br>
We cannot do with more than four,<br>
To give a hand to each.'<br>
</p>

<p>
The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br>
But never a word he said:<br>
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br>
And shook his heavy head --<br>
Meaning to say he did not choose<br>
To leave the oyster-bed.<br>
</p>

<p>
Out four young Oysters hurried up.
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat --
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.
</p>

<p>
Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more --
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.
</p>

<p>
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.
</p>

<p>
'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
'To talk of many things:
Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --
Of cabbages -- and kings --
And why the sea is boiling hot --
And whether pigs have wings.'
</p>

<p>
'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,
'Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!'
'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.
</p>

<p>
'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
'Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed --
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'
</p>

<p>
'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
'After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!'
'The night is fine,' the Walrus said,
'Do you admire the view?'
</p>

<p>
'It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'Cut us another slice-
I wish you were not quite so deaf-
I've had to ask you twice!'
</p>

<p>
'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,
'To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'The butter's spread too thick!'
</p>

<p>
'I weep for you,'the Walrus said:
'I deeply sympathize.'
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.
</p>

<p>
'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
'You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none --
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one.
