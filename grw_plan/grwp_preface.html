              Preface
            </h3>

            <p>
              The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is the second edition of what professional planners call a <em>"watershed management plan."</em> The first edition was called <cite>"The Genesee River Wilds Project"</cite> and appeared in 2008.  It was updated incrementally thereafter, but a thorough revision was overdue.  The title of this 2016 edition represents the greater maturity of the plan's design, support, and implementation. The changes are significant enough that it may be treated as a new document.
            </p>

            <p>
              The target of this plan is the upper Genesee River (its southernmost section, since the Genesee River flows north).  The area identified as the "Genesee River Wilds" stretches 70 miles from the river’s sources in Potter County, PA, to the southern boundary of Letchworth State Park in NY.  The phrase "Genesee River Wilds" plays a dual role as a marketing tool and an expression of the plan's goal of restoring a corridor of wilderness along the Genesee River and its major tributaries. The phrase therefore epitomizes the plan's approach.  The plan integrates conservation, recreation, and economic development by promoting the creation of minimally-invasive infrastructure for eco-tourism and other sustainable business.

                  It's all about the trees:  The Genesee River as viewed looking eastward through trees on the river's western bank on land donated to Genesee River Wilds, Inc., near Caneadea, NY.  The land is next to NYS Rt. 19 at the site known as the <a href="http://townofcaneadea.org/content/History">"Great Angle."</a>  The name of the "Great Angle" is derived from its location at the point in which the Genesee River turns from an overall northwesterly flow to a primarily northeasterly direction. On the hill behind the eastern bank seen in the distance was a Seneca Indian village with a large council house.  In the 1700s the Council House was frequented by Chief Shongo and reportedly echoed with the voices of famous Senecas such as Red Jacket and Cornplanter. After the Seneca land was taken over by white settlers, the Council House fell into disrepair.  Around 1871 its remains were purchased by William Pryor Letchworth and restored on his former estate in Letchworth State Park. The trees preserved by Genesee River Wilds at the Great Angle represent a small sample of the plan's goal for restoring historic buffers that once protected the river and its riparian habitat.

The Senecas were agriculturalists and harvested timber, but on pre-industrial scales with less dramatic impact on the forests depicted along the river's banks.  The forests provided fish and wildlife habitat, a natural water purification system, and buffers against flooding, erosion, and sedimentation.  Although the full extent of these riparian (streamside) forest buffers can never be restored, economic incentives and other appeals to the same kind of motives that led to their destruction can generate community support for protecting those that remain and gradually expanding their current size.  This strategy is much less expensive in the rural communities of the upper Genesee River watershed than in urban and suburban Rochester.

                <h4>Approach</h4>

                  <p>
                    The primary strategy for water conservation advocated in this plan is remarkably simple:  Plant trees.  More fully, create permanent buffers of riparian (streamside) forests that restore the Genesee River while protecting it from future development along its edges.  This strategy is much less expensive, more comprehensive in its benefits, and more effective in the long run than strategies emphasizing cement and artificial rock structures.  Such engineering technologies provide immediate success in addressing the river's phosphorus and sediment loads, but they offer little in the way of wildlife habitat or the long-term stability of better zoning practices.  Worse, they can be counter-productive if not complemented by a rigorous emphasis on land conservation.  Placing too high a priority on riverbank engineering inadvertently teaches people that the negative consequences of ongoing future development up to the edge of the river and its tributaries can easily be addressed in the same way.  The resulting unmitigated expansion of riverside development and spiral in the costs that it brings simply cannot be sustained in the long run.  In contrast, the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> emphasizes the more sustainable practices associated with what is often called a "natural systems approach."
                  </p>

                   <p>
                     More distinctive to this plan is its approach to the challenging problem of how to get people to apply this otherwise simple strategy.  The thesis of the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is that creating a massive nature park system that extends the benefits of such a system to an equally wide array of stakeholders offers the needed scale and variety of incentives.  This is expressed in the plan's broader overall strategy of creating a system of nature parks and green spaces that effectively extends Letchworth State Park to the river's sources in PA one piece at a time.
                   </p>

                <h4>Assumptions</h4>

                  <p>
                    The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite>'s limited use of the phrase "watershed management plan" emphasizes the difference between the Genesee River Wilds approach and previous efforts at conservation of the upper Genesee River.  The fundamental assumption in the terminology of "watershed management" is that humans are masters of their environment rather than just a part of it.  This assumption has guided the use and abuse of the Genesee River since Europeans and their descendants began to settle in the river valley in the 1700s.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The Genesee River Wilds initiative operates on a different assumption: It is <em>humans</em>, not the watershed, who need managing.  The Genesee River is impaired because we have not managed <em>ourselves</em> very well.  It is <em>humans</em> who ultimately stripped away the riverside forests that once provided habitat for nesting bald eagles, American river otters, and other wildlife.  Humans removed far too many of the trees that once stablized the Genesee River's banks against erosion; minimized flooding through transpiration of excess water during high water events; provided shade to cool water for fish; barricaded the river against toxic runoff; filtered rain draining through soils into aquifers; fed tiny acquatic life that offered feasts to species higher in the food chain; captured carbon to mitigate climate change; and assured that the Genesee would contribute water of the highest quality to the international treasure of Lake Ontario.  We have no one to blame but <em>ourselves</em> for the impairments that have endangered the safety, health, and quality of life in our own communities from the river's sources all the way downstream to the shores of one of the Great Lakes.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Conservation therefore must be viewed as a <em>human</em> problem rather than merely an environmental problem.  The human problem cannot be addressed without a greater role for anthropology, economics, sociology, and other specializations directly focused on humans.  The biological and environmental science behind most previous approaches to conservation of the Genesee River is for this reason fundamentally flawed.  Conservation efforts disproportionately dominated by specialists in biological and environmental sciences ironically tend to pay insufficient attention to the vast history of biological evolution behind what we ourselves as biological creatures bring to conservation. Human evolution generates a variety of behavioral and cognitive tendencies that often make it difficult for us to make scientifically defensible choices in a world more complex than the one in which our Paleolithic ancestors emerged in Africa.  Enviable expertise in the geoscience of lakes and rivers is no guarantee of competence in addressing this human problem.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Previous approaches to conservation of the Genesee River also have not appealed to a broad enough array of the motivations that human evolution provides for addressing the problems created by its limitations.  The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> offers incentives for better conservation practices by tapping into a more comprehensive variety of human needs.  These allow us to draw on sources of energy humans normally devote to economic activity, family and communal well-being, physical health, education of children, providing a legacy for future generations, and just having fun.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Marshalling this broader array of energy sources offers far more hope for meeting the challenges of restoring riparian (streamside) forest buffers along the Genesee River on an ambitious scale.  The PA DCNR already incorporates this more integrative approach in its own conservation efforts because it combines both conservation and state park management in the same agency.  A statewide greenways initiative begun in PA in the late 1990s has also encouraged much greater collaboration between the PA DCNR and PennDOT.  The compartmentalization of the same responsibilities between three separate agencies in NY (NYSDOT, NYSOPRHP, and NYSDEC) poses greater challenges to such an integrative approach.  However, officials in all three agencies have proven remarkably supportive of the work of the Genesee River Wilds from its very inception.  NYSDEC also has taken steps toward a more integrative approach under the rubric of what is sometimes called "eco-system based management."
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    No matter what it is called, any approach that is successful in conservation of the Genesee River on a truly long-lasting and comprehensive scale will have to involve entire communities.  Previous efforts have not been able to reverse decades of neglect or provide any significant protections against the construction of riverside housing developments or other rapidly growing threats because they were never even designed to be applied on such a large long-term scale.  An approach that operates on this scale will require appealing to the same broad array of human interests that motivated two centuries of widespread destruction of riparian forests in the first place.  If communities can be persuaded to restore to the river more of the wilderness space it once had along its edges, then the missing acres of riparian forests will quickly grow back, the river will heal itself, and these same communities will enjoy more of the untapped potential that better treatment of the river promises.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> offers precisely this kind of broad-based holistic approach.  Although it may be more ambitious in its conservation goals than other plans, it also applies a strategy big and bold enough to present a more fitting match for the daunting scale of the challenge.
