              Introduction to the Genesee River Wilds
            </h3>

<h4>A Neglected Resource</h4>

              <p>
                The Genesee River is one of the most spectacular rivers in the northeastern USA.  The river originates with small tributaries flowing northward from the ridge of a triple continental divide in Potter County, PA.  These quickly gather volume on their downhill run toward their confluence in Genesee, PA.  After crossing the PA/NY state line, the river's power gradually increases before plunging over three breathtaking falls in Letchworth State Park, NY.  At the park's northern end the river exits a massive flood mitigation dam in Mt. Morris.  From there it flows more lazily through rolling farmlands toward New York State's third largest city. In Rochester it cascades over another three majestic falls before emptying into the vast viewscape of Lake Ontario. The river's great beauty and its value as one the largest tributaries into a Great Lake justify significant investment in its protection and nurture.
              </p>

              <p>
                Two events occurred in 1972 that should have aroused even more interest in its conservation. One was the devastating flooding of the Genesee River resulting from Hurricane Agnes. The other was the passage of federal laws now classified under the Clean Water Act.  In 1987 these were supplemented by an agreement between the USA and Canada that identified the Rochester Embayment as one of 43 "Areas of Concern" in the Great Lakes.  In the subsequent decades heroic efforts did indeed produce some noteworthy achievements in the conservation of the Genesee River.

                    Genesee River watershed boundaries with riverside multi-use trails in Triple Divide Trail System (Rochester, NY, to Williamsport, PA), recently incorporated into route of 400-mile long Genesee-Susquehanna Greenway (Lake Ontario in Rochester, NY, to Chesapeake Bay in Havre de Grace, MD).  The trail system strategically functions as a toehold for creating a wider corridor of forested riparian (streamside) buffers that will provide additional protections for the Genesee River and other water resources along the corridor.

This section of the river provides abundant habitat for bald eagles, American River Otters, and other wildlife.  It demonstrates how easily the river and its tributaries can heal themselves if provided more space in the floodplains for forested buffers to grow.

                    The grey-green color of the Genesee River in this photo taken near Angelica, in Allegany County, NY, is produced partly by sediment deposited into the river by erosion.  The lack of trees along most of the bank here is a major cause of the visible damage from flooding and erosion, which negatively impacts communities all the way downstream to Rochester.  Even in this image the tenacious willow trees and the unrefined beauty of the river hint at how easily the Genesee can be restored if a wider corridor is more consistently reserved for trees.

                Yet by the early 2000s it had become increasingly clear that improvements in the water quality in one part of the Genesee watershed were being undermined by the more rapid pace of opposing developments in others. Repeated studies of the Genesee River's water chemistry revealed only insignificant improvements in phosphorus and sediment loads since a pilot study that began in 1974 (e.g, 1974-78, 1991, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2007).  Phosphorus and other agricultural runoff feed algae blooms that endanger Lake Ontario's fishery and the health of shoreline communities.  Sediment deposited into the river by erosion imposes a burden on taxpayers by requiring dredging at Mt. Morris Dam and the Rochester harbor.
              </p>

              <p>
                More recent research has reaffirmed the results of past studies.  A study in 2012 concluded that the Genesee River still ranked 32nd among all rivers in the country in pounds of toxic materials discharged into its waters. Studies published by teams from SUNY Brockport in 2013-2014 reached the unsurprising conclusion that the Genesee River ranks as number one source of phosphorus among all tributaries into Lake Ontario from New York State alone.  Out of all other tributaries into the lake it is second only to the Niagara River, which drains all the other Great Lakes.  This research has also demonstrated that the upper Genesee River south of Letchworth State Park is a significant source of these problems.  This is certainly not a new discovery, especially to the river's advocates in the upper Genesee watershed.  However, the unprecedented detail of the SUNY Brockport research has brought welcome attention to what they already had been saying for many years.
              </p>

              <p>
                Investments that had produced measurable successes near the river's mouth in Rochester have never been complemented by comparable investment in the upstream area south of Letchworth State Park.  Even federal and state officials with regional responsibilities extending into the rural headwaters area in the south often prefer to devote their attention to parts of the watershed with higher profiles.  The proximity between the stunning views in Letchworth and the adjacent portion of the watershed immediately south of the park makes the relative lack of investment in the southern portion especially puzzling.  Given the ease with which the beauty, wildlife habitat, and water quality in the rural upper reaches of the Genesee River can be coaxed back when given relief from abuse, the impression of the southern part of the watershed has long been one of profoundly tragic neglect.
              </p>

          <h4>The Need for a New Approach</h4>

          <p>
            Water obviously flows downstream.  Consequently even researchers focused on the lower Genesee River and Lake Ontario often recognize that it is counter-productive to neglect the rural headwaters upstream.  They more often fail to understand that social and economic factors are fundamental to previous failures in conservation of the upper Genesee River. These factors demand an approach different from those applied with such meager success over the forty years that followed the 1972 flood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any casual observer in the early 2000s would have seen that greater attention to the dangers of construction and cultivation in the floodplains in the upper Genesee had not placed much restraint on actual practice.  Flooding and erosion continued on a regular basis in this area, with floodwaters in 1996 even reaching volumes similar to those achieved during Hurricane Agnes. The resulting destruction provided fresh lessons upon which the area's elected representatives could have capitalized to enact fiscally responsible policies directing development farther away from the floodplains. Instead, the more typical response was to intensify efforts to tame the river with expensive concrete and rock.  Heavy metals and carcinogens such as benzene leaching into the Genesee River from the Sinclair Oil Refinery and industrial park in Wellsville, NY, led to the site's registration on the national priority list for hazardous waste remediation in 1983.  This had required expensive cleanup work that was not completed until 2012. At the very same time, new threats to the river's health were emerging from industrial activities nearby.
          </p>
          <p>
            Advocates for better practices in the southern part of the Genesee River watershed also seemed increasingly outmatched.  The area had received noble attention from local Trout Unlimited chapters, the Potter County Conservation District, and a group recently formed on the PA side (Upper Genesee Headwaters Watershed Association).  But the true scale of the challenge is stubbornly evident in Allegany County, NY.
          </p>
          <p>
            The area's rural poverty poses an immediate barrier to any approach to conservation that does not promise increased eco-tourism or some other demonstrable economic benefit.  Concern in rural county offices with property tax losses resulting from conservation easements and large state forest preserves makes it difficult to generate support for river conservation efforts that might pose even further restrictions on land usage.  NY state officials miss opportunities to alleviate these concerns because they often fall short in capitalizing on the economic potential of their conservation efforts.  For example, no signs appear on I-86 in Allegany County to entice passing tourists into the vast acres of state forests easily visible from the highway.  Requirements for grants from relevant agencies demand matching funds, political leverage, staff, and technical expertise more typical of large cities and wealthy suburbs.  Potential allies downstream in population centers near Lake Ontario are rarely even aware of these and other economic, social, and political obstacles to conservation in the rural areas upstream.
          </p>

          <h4>Genesee River Wilds</h4>
              <p>
                Discussions of these problems by a few locals in the late spring of 2008 led to the formal launch of the Genesee River Wilds initiative later that summer. This was staged in Belvidere, NY, on August 11, 2008.  Although the meeting was hosted by officials from Allegany County, NY, the broader extent of the Genesee watershed was signified by the presence of four New York State officials from two agencies and two regions of the state.  This was further affirmed by the presence of the director of the Genesee Valley Conservancy, which is headquartered in Livingston County. The meeting also affirmed partnerships emerging across state lines through its main speaker from PA and summaries of previous conversations with officials in PA.
              </p>

              <p>
                The fledgling group's rudimentary watershed plan was called <cite>Genesee River Wilds Project: Comprehensive Program</cite> when it was completed in Sept. 2008. This was subsequently edited for web format. The most significant update was the <cite>Triple Divide Trail System Strategic Plan</cite> released in PDF in Sept. 2010 (with minor editing in March 2011). This fleshed out the foundational proposal from spring of 2008 for a system of blueways, multi-use trails, nature parks, and watershed conservation from Rochester, NY, to Williamsport, PA. These plans shaped the charter documents of Genesee River Wilds, Inc., which was granted 501(c)3 status by the IRS in 20??.  The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> of 2016 will promote wider recognition and guide increased collaboration.
              </p>

            <p>
              The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> identifies its targeted portion of the Genesee River watershed as the "Genesee River Wilds." This refers to the section of the Genesee river basin from the river's sources at the triple continental divide in Potter County, PA, downstream to the current southern boundary of Letchworth State Park in Portageville, NY.
            </p>

            <p>
              The phrase "Genesee River Wilds" plays multiple roles.  It expresses this plan's goal of restoring the historic corridors of forested <em>wilderness</em> along the Genesee River and its major tributaries. Allusion to the excitement of "wild" behavior also epitomizes the plan's strategy of generating interest in conservation through outdoor recreation. The phrase also serves as a marketing tool, which illustrates the plan's concern with eco-tourism and other sustainable sources of economic development.  The Genesee River begins in the magnificent 12-county region of PA known as the Pennsylvania Wilds.  "Genesee River Wilds" therefore ideally represents the overlap with this region in the plan's target area and the emphasis on partnerships across the NY/PA state line that have played a key role in this initiative since 2008.  The revised version of the  <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> continues to integrate conservation, recreation, and economic development on a scale that can only be achieved by collaboration across state lines.
            </p>

        <h4>A Note on Terminology</h4>

            <p>
              The phrase "Upper Genesee River" is also used to refer to the target area in the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> because it is more familiar outside the region.  This phrase refers to the southernmost sections of the Genesee River because the river flows northward. In this plan the geographical scope of "upper Genesee River" is roughly synonymous with that of "Genesee River Wilds." Both refer only to the part of the basin south of the southern boundary of Letchworth State Park. This contrasts with the common practice of drawing the boundary between the "upper Genesee" and the "lower Genesee" further north at the confluence of the Genesee River and Canaseraga Creek in Mt. Morris, NY.   But the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is hardly unique in this use of the terminology. Pragmatic considerations often segment out a "middle" section or create a secondary boundary in Portageville.  The recent SUNY Brockport study of the "Upper Genesee River Watershed" cited Portageville in this way to limit its own research boundaries to the same portion of the watershed addressed in this plan (Makarewicz, Lewis, Snyder, and Smith 2013 [Vol. 2]). Even NYSDEC and NYSOPRHP reaffirm this tradition in the actual implementation of their own plans because both agencies place their regional administrative boundaries near Portageville. In contrast to more restricted efforts, this plan is not limited by the state line.
