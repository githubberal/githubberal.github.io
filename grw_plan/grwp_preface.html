                It's all about the trees:  Genesee River as viewed looking eastward through trees on the river's western bank at the site of the <a href="http://townofcaneadea.org/content/History">"Great Angle" near Caneadea, NY</a>.  The "Great Angle" is named from its location at the point in which the Genesee River turns from its overall northwesterly flow to a primarily northeasterly direction. On the hill behind the eastern bank seen in the distance in the photo was a Seneca Indian village with a large Council House.  In the 1700s the Council House echoed with the voices of leading Senecas such as Red Jacket and Cornplanter.  The Seneca land was eventually taken by white settlers and the Council House fell into disrepair.  Around 1871 its remains were purchased by William Pryor Letchworth and restored for use in a reconstruction that now stands on his former estate in Letchworth State Park. The land next to NYS Rt. 19 from which this photo was taken was donated to Genesee River Wilds, Inc.  Its trees represent a small sample of the Genesee River Wilds goal for restoring historic buffers that once protected the river and its riparian habitat.

                  The <em>Genesee River Wilds Plan</em> is the second edition of what professional planners call a "watershed management plan." The first edition of this plan appeared in 2008 and was called "Genesee River Wilds Project."  The target of this plan is the upper Genesee River from the riverâ€™s sources in Potter County, Pennsylvania, to the southern boundary of Letchworth State Park in New York State.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The conservation strategy advocated in this plan is remarkably simple:  Plant trees.  More fully, create permanent buffers of riparian (streamside) forests that restore the Genesee River while protecting it from future development along its edges.  This approach is much less expensive and far more effective in the long run than other approaches.  This plan addresses the more challenging problem of how to get people to do what is actually quite simple.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The plan's limited use of the phrase "watershed management plan" emphasizes the difference between the Genesee River wilds approach and previous efforts at conservation of this section of the river.  The fundamental assumption in the terminology of "watershed management" is that humans are masters of their environment rather than just a part of it.  This assumption has guided the use and abuse of the Genesee River since Europeans and their descendants began to settle in the river valley in the 1700s.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Genesee River Wilds initiative began with a different assumption: It is humans, not the watershed, who need managing.  The Genesee River is impaired because we have not managed <em>ourselves</em> very well.  It is humans who ultimately stripped the riverside forests that once provided habitat for nesting bald eagles, American river otters, and other wildlife.  Humans stripped away the trees that once stablized riverbanks against erosion, minimized flooding through transpiration of excess water during high water events, provided shade to cool water for fish, captured carbon to mitigate climate change, barricaded the river against toxic runoff, filtered water draining through soils into the aquifers that feed the river, fed tiny acquatic life that offered feasts to species higher in the food chain, and in many other ways assured the richness of the Genesee River corridor.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Conservation must therefore be viewed as a <em>human</em> problem rather than merely an environmental science problem.  The science behind previous approaches is flawed because it does not pay sufficient attention to the vast history of human evolution behind what we bring to conservation. Human evolution generates a variety of behavioral and cognitive tendencies that do not condition us to make consistently wise choices in a world far more complex than the one in which our Paleolithic ancestors emerged in Africa.
                </p>

                  <p>Previous approaches to conservation of the Genesee River have not appealed to a broad enough array of the motivations evolution provides.  The Genesee River Wilds Plan offers incentives for better conservation practices by tapping into a more comprehensive variety of human needs.  These allow us to draw on sources of energy humans normally devote to economics, community, health, family, education of children, providing a legacy for future generations, and just having fun.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Marshalling this broader array of energy sources offers far more hope for meeting the challenges of restoring the forested riparian (streamside) buffers along the Genesee River on an ambitious scale.  The PA DCNR already incorporates this more integrative approach in its own conservation efforts because it combines both conservation and state park management in the same agency.  A statewide greenways initiative begun in PA in the late 1990s has also encouraged much greater collaboration between the PA DCNR and PennDOT.  The compartmentalization of the same responsibilities between three separate agencies in NY (NYSDOT, NYSOPRHP, and NYSDEC) poses greater challenges to such an integrative approach.  However, officials in all three agencies have proven remarkably supportive of the work of the Genesee River Wilds right from the start.  NYSDEC also has taken steps toward a more integrative approach by adopting what its proponents call "eco-system based management."
                </p>

                  <p>
                    No matter what it is called, any approach that is successful will have to involve entire communities if it is to operate on the massive scale needed to reverse previous decades of neglect and keep up with the pace of rapidly growing threats.  Such an ambitious approach will require appealing to the same comprehensive array of interests that motivated two centuries of destruction of riparian forests in the first place.  The Genesee River Wilds Plan seeks to apply precisely this kind of holistic approach.  Although it may be ambitious in its conservation goals, it also offers a strategy comprehensive enough to match the scale of the challenge.
