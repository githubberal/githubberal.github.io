<h4>History</h4>

              <p>
                The Genesee River is one of the most spectacular rivers in the entire northeastern USA.  The river begins in Potter County, PA, and flows northward over three breathtaking falls in Letchworth State Park, NY.  After exiting Mt. Morris Dam, it cascades over three more majestic falls in Rochester before emptying into the wide viewscape of Lake Ontario. The river's great beauty and its value as one the largest tributaries into one of the Great Lakes merit far more investment in its conservation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Two events occurred in 1972 that should have aroused even more interest in its restoration and protection.  One was the devastating flooding of the Genesee River resulting from Hurricane Agnes. The other was the passage of federal laws now classified with other legislation under the Clean Water Act.  In the subsequent decades heroic efforts did indeed produce some noteworthy achievements in dealing with conservation problems in the Genesee watershed.
              </p>

              <p>
                Yet by the early 2000s it had become increasingly clear that improvements in the water quality in one area were being undermined by the more rapid pace of opposing developments in others.  Repeated studies of the Genesee River's water chemistry and its impact on Lake Ontario revealed only insignificant improvements in key elements since pilot studies had started in 1974.  Measurable successes from investments near the river's mouth in Rochester were confounded by the lack of comparable investment in the upstream area south of NY's Letchworth State Park.  Greater attention to the dangers of construction and cultivation in the floodplains in the upper Genesee had not placed much restraint on actual practice.  Costly flooding and erosion continued on a regular basis in this area, with floodwaters in 1996 even reaching volumes similar to those achieved during Hurricane Agnes.  Such emergencies provided fresh lessons upon which local community leaders could have capitalized by courageously enacting fiscally responsible policies that would have directed more of future development away from the floodplains.  Instead, they more often intensified their efforts to obtain grants to tame the river with expensive concrete and rock.  Significant progress was being made in the remediation of the former Sinclair Oil Refinery and industrial waste facility, which had poisoned the municipal water extracted from the Genesee River in Wellsville, NY.  At the same time, new threats to the river's health were emerging from industrial activities in communities nearby.

                    Genesee River watershed boundaries with riverside multi-use trails in Triple Divide Trail System (Rochester, NY, to Williamsport, PA), recently incorporated into route of 400-mile long Genesee-Susquehanna Greenway (Lake Ontario in Rochester, NY, to Chesapeake Bay in Havre de Grace, MD).  The trail system strategically functions as a toehold for creating a wider corridor of forested riparian (streamside) buffers that will provide additional protections for the Genesee River and other water resources along the corridor.

                  It's all about the trees:  The Genesee River as viewed looking eastward through trees on the river's western bank on land donated to Genesee River Wilds, Inc., near Caneadea, NY.  The land is next to NYS Rt. 19 at the site known as the <a href="http://townofcaneadea.org/content/History">"Great Angle."</a>  The name of the "Great Angle" is derived from its location at the point in which the Genesee River turns from an overall northwesterly flow to a primarily northeasterly direction. On the hill behind the eastern bank seen in the distance was a Seneca Indian village with a large council house.  The trees preserved by Genesee River Wilds at the Great Angle represent a small sample of the plan's goal for restoring historic riverside forests.

Forested buffers provide wildlife habitat; shade to cool water for fish; food for acquatic life eaten by fish; a natural water purification system; carbon storage to limit climate change; and buffers against costly flooding, erosion, and sedimentation.  Restoring wide forested riparian (streamside) buffers is far less expensive and far more effective in the long run than other efforts to achieve these goals.

                Leaders in Potter County, PA, and local Trout Unlimited chapters had done impressive stream restoration projects in the Genesee headwaters.  But advocates for protecting this part of the Genesee River watershed seemed increasingly outmatched.  This was especially the case in Allegany County, NY.  The area's rural poverty made it difficult to generate support from key municipal leaders. Requirements for grants from relevant agencies demand matching funds, political leverage, staff, and technical expertise more typical of large cities and wealthy suburbs.  Water flowing downstream from the southern part of the watershed has a visible impact on the populated areas to the north around Lake Ontario. Yet differences between worldviews at the opposite extremes of the watershed make it difficult for the few potential allies near the lakeshore to understand the economic, social, and political obstacles to conservation in the rural areas upstream.  Even federal and state officials with regional responsibilities extending into the rural headwaters area often prefer to devote their attention to parts of the watershed with higher profiles.  Given how easily the beauty and wildlife habitat in the southern part of the watershed can be coaxed back when given relief from abuse, the impression of the river in this area has long been one of profoundly tragic neglect.
              </p>

              <p>
                Discussions of these problems by a few locals in the late spring of 2008 led to the formal launch of the Genesee River Wilds initiative later that summer. This was staged in Belvidere, NY, on August 11, 2008. Attendees symbolically affirmed partnerships emerging across state lines in NY and PA.* The fledgling group's rudimentary watershed plan was called <cite>Genesee River Wilds Project: Comprehensive Program</cite> when it was completed in Sept. 2008. The plan subsequently appeared without the subtitle in website format, which allowed incremental updates. The most significant was the 61-page PDF of the <cite>Triple Divide Trail System Strategic Plan</cite> released in Sept. 2010 (with minor updates in March 2011). This detailed a proposed system of watershed conservation, blueways, multi-use trails, and nature parks from Rochester, NY, to Williamsport, PA.  This represented a key element of the Genesee River Wilds initiative's foundational concepts and drew upon discussions with officials from both NY and PA that had been going on since the spring of 2008.  These plans shaped the charter documents of Genesee River Wilds, Inc., which was registered in New York State in 20?? and granted 501(c)3 status by the IRS in 20??.  The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> of 2016 will promote wider recognition and guide increased collaboration.
              </p>

        <h4>Terminology</h4>

            <p>
              The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> identifies its targeted portion of the Genesee River watershed as the "Genesee River Wilds." This refers to the section of the Genesee river basin from the river's sources at the triple continental divide in Potter County, PA, downstream to the current southern boundary of Letchworth State Park in Portageville, NY.
            </p>

            <p>
              The phrase "Genesee River Wilds" plays multiple roles.  It expresses this plan's goal of restoring the historic corridors of forested <em>wilderness</em> along the Genesee River and its major tributaries. Allusion to the excitement of "wild" behavior also epitomizes the plan's strategy.  Interest in restoring riverside wilderness is promoted through outdoor recreation.  The phrase also serves as a marketing tool, which illustrates the plan's concern with eco-tourism. The Genesee River Wilds target area also directly overlaps the magnificent 12-county region of PA known as the Pennsylvania Wilds. This allows "Genesee River Wilds" to represent the sharing of strategies, energy, and resources across the NY/PA state line in the target area.  This partnership has been central to the original plan's approach since the summer of 2008.  The revised version of the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> continues to integrate conservation, recreation, and economic development by promoting the creation of minimally-invasive infrastructure for eco-tourism and other sustainable business on a scale that can only be achieved by collaboration across state lines.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Upper Genesee River" is also used to refer to the target area because this phrase is more familiar outside the region.  The phrase refers to the southernmost sections of the Genesee River because the river flows northward.  In this plan the geographical scope of "upper Genesee River" is synonymous with that of "Genesee River Wilds." Both refer only to the part of the basin south of the southern boundary of Letchworth State Park. This contrasts with the common practice of drawing the boundary between the "upper Genesee" and the "lower Genesee" further north at the confluence of the Genesee River and Canaseraga Creek in Mt. Morris, NY.  But the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is hardly unique in this use of the terminology.  Pragmatic considerations often segment out a "middle" section or create a secondary boundary in Portageville. One of the most important recent studies of the "Upper Genesee River Watershed" cited Portageville in this way to limit its own research boundaries to the same portion of the watershed addressed in this plan (Makarewicz, Lewis, Snyder, and Smith 2013 [Vol. 2]). Even NYSDEC and NYSOPRHP reaffirm this tradition in the actual implementation of their own plans because both agencies place their regional administrative boundaries near Portageville. In contrast to more restricted efforts, this plan is not limited by the state line.
            </p>

              <h4>Approach</h4>

              <p>
                The primary strategy for water conservation advocated in this plan is remarkably simple:  Plant trees.  More fully, create permanent buffers of riparian (streamside) forests that restore the Genesee River while protecting it from future development along its edges.  As the section of this plan devoted to this issue indicates, the plan follows the recommendations of the USDA and other agencies in its goals for the minimum widths of forested riparian buffers.  Instead of trying to tame the river with costly artificial structures that inadvertently encourage even more irresponsible behavior, the emphasis on restoring forested riparian buffers in this plan represents what is often called a "natural systems approach." In contrast to the spiraling costs of building more and more rock and concrete structures to address the new problems created by counter-productive behaviors, this plan's approach is more economically sustainable in the long run.
              </p>

              <p>
                More distinctive to this plan is its approach to the challenging problem of how to get people to apply this otherwise simple strategy.  The thesis of the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is that creating a massive nature park system that extends the benefits of such a system to an equally wide array of stakeholders offers the necessary regional scale and needed variety of incentives.  This is expressed in the plan's broader overall strategy of creating a system of nature parks and green spaces that effectively extends Letchworth State Park to the river's sources in PA one piece at a time.
              </p>

              <h4>Models</h4>

              <p>Previous plans for conservation of the Genesee River have been surprisingly timid about pursuing a model of conservation that stares every planner in the face.  Letchworth State Park in NY is arguably the most successful model for conservation of the Genesee River in the entire watershed.  The emphasis on forestry in the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> finds other models in the watershed in the protective forests around Hemlock and Canadice Lake and the patches of state forest lands around small headwaters streams.  However, Letchworth best illustrates the excitement that can be generated by integrating conservation with outdoor recreation, education, eco-tourism, and other priorities in this plan.  The same strategy has proven successful in many other nature parks, greenways, and other settings that otherwise cannot match the spectacular features of Letchworth.  This plan not only applies such an approach, but also capitalizes on the success of Letchworth by directly tying the Genesee River Wilds into Letchworth itself.</p>

              <p>The connectivity with PA promoted in this plan capitalizes on the potential of integration with a complementary model, which is the spectacular Pine Creek Gorge in PA. Etc.
              </p>

              <p>
                Genesee Valley Conservancy shows that it can be done:   Recently celebrated its 25th year by exceeding Letcworth.  The GVC also shows how it's done:   A piece at at time.  Others, SGP River Towns program.  PA Wilds link above etc.  Include videos!

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Progress: GSG meeting etc.
                  </p>


                    <p>
                      Reason why this is impnt.: It provides resources. etc. shows it can be done.  Big plans require big resources.  One way to secure the necessary leverage is by building big alliances. Since its inception in 2008, the Genesee River Wilds initiative has building numerous alliances across state lines in both NY and PA.  This has resulted in the integration of the relevant features of this plan into appropriate points in other planning documents in both NY and PA.  One illustration of these alliances that is so recent that it is still largely conceptual demonstrates how planning on this scale can lead to even larger alliances that promise more leverage.  This is the GSG.

                    <h4>Notes</h4>
                    <p>
                      *Attendees at launch meeting in August 11, 2008, represented a cross-section of officials from state, county, township, and non-profit agencies (NYSOPRHP, two reps.; NYSDEC, two reps.; All. Co. Chamber of Commerce, Legislature, Development, History, Tourism, and SWCD, various, including quorum of county legislators; Town of Amity; Genesee Valley Conservancy; Trout Unlimited; SUNY Alfred; St. Joseph's Univ.). The meeting was chaired by the president of the chamber of commerce in Allegany County, NY.  It featured a keynote presentation by a professor from a university in Philadelphia, PA.  He transmitted insights from discussions in July with the Executive Director of the PA Wilds office in the PA DCNR and briefer exchanges with officials in northern PA (esp. Tioga County).  The current director of the Allegany County Planning office was at that time GIS coordinator for the Village of Wellsville and had been involved in the discussions since early June.  Some of the key allies in the Williamsport area were already expressing their support for the larger trail plan by Sept. 2008.  Collaboration with key figures in the Rochester area was solidified by late 2009.
