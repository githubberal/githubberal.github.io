            <h4>Terminology</h4>

              <p>
                The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is what is sometimes called a <em>"watershed management plan."</em>  This plan will avoid the phrase "watershed management" to emphasize   Instead it will emphasize strategies for addressing the economic and other <em>human</em> factors in water conservation.  is our own human failure to better manage <em>ourselves</em>.  The first rudimentary version was called <cite>"The Genesee River Wilds Project"</cite> and appeared in 2008.  It was updated incrementally thereafter, but a thorough revision was overdue.  The changes in this revision are significant enough that it may be treated as a new document.
              </p>

              <p>
                This plan identifies the targeted portion of the Genesee River watershed as the "Genesee River Wilds." This refers to the section of the Genesee river basin from the river's sources at the triple continental divide in Potter County, PA, downstream to the current southern boundary of Letchworth State Park in Portageville, NY.
              </p>

              <p>
                The phrase "upper Genesee River" is also used to refer to the target area because this phrase is more familiar outside the region.  This refers to the southernmost sections of the Genesee River because the river flows northward.  In this plan the geographical scope of "upper Genesee River" is synonymous with that of "Genesee River Wilds." Both refer only to the sub-basin south of the southern boundary of Letchworth State Park. This contrasts with the common practice of drawing the boundary between the "upper Genesee" and the "lower Genesee" further north at the confluence of the Genesee River and Canaseraga Creek in Mt. Morris, NY.  However, practical considerations often segment out a "middle" section or create a secondary boundary in Portageville. One of the most important recent studies of the "Upper Genesee River Watershed" defined its own research boundaries in the same way (Makarewicz, Lewis, Snyder, and Smith 2013 [Vol. 2]). Even NYSDEC and NYSOPRHP reaffirm this tradition in the implementation of their own plans because both agencies place their regional administrative boundaries near Portageville.
              </p>

              <p>
                The phrase "Genesee River Wilds" plays multiple roles.  It expresses this plan's goal of restoring the historic corridors of <em>wilderness</em> along the Genesee River and its major tributaries. It also epitomizes the plan's strategy.  Interest in restoring this wilderness is promoted through outdoor recreation, which sometimes can be "wild."  The phrase also serves as a marketing tool, which illustrates the plan's concern with eco-tourism. The Genesee River Wilds target area also directly overlaps the magnificent 12-county region of PA known as the Pennsylvania Wilds. This allows "Genesee River Wilds" to represent the sharing of strategies, energy, and resources across the NY/PA state line in the target area.  This partnership has been central to the original plan's approach since the summer of 2008.  The revised version of the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> continues to integrate conservation, recreation, and economic development by promoting the creation of minimally-invasive infrastructure for eco-tourism and other sustainable business on a scale that can only be achieved by collaboration across state lines.
              </p>

              <p>
                The primary strategy for water conservation advocated in this plan is remarkably simple:  Plant trees.  More fully, create permanent buffers of riparian (streamside) forests that restore the Genesee River while protecting it from future development along its edges.  As the section of this plan devoted to this issue indicates, the plan follows the recommendations of the USDA and other agencies in its goals for the minimum widths of forested riparian buffers.
              </p>

              <p>
                More distinctive to this plan is its approach to the challenging problem of how to get people to apply this otherwise simple strategy.  The thesis of the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is that creating a massive nature park system that extends the benefits of such a system to an equally wide array of stakeholders offers the needed scale and variety of incentives.  This is expressed in the plan's broader overall strategy of creating a system of nature parks and green spaces that effectively extends Letchworth State Park to the river's sources in PA one piece at a time.
              </p>


              <p>
                The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite>'s limited use of the phrase "watershed management plan" emphasizes the difference between the Genesee River Wilds approach and previous efforts at conservation of the upper Genesee River.  The fundamental assumption in the terminology of "watershed management" is that humans are masters of their environment rather than just a part of it.  In contrast, the Genesee River Wilds initiative operates on a different assumption: It is <em>humans</em>, not the watershed, who need managing.  The Genesee River is impaired because we have not managed <em>ourselves</em> very well.

              </p>
                <p>
                  It's all about the trees:  The Genesee River as viewed looking eastward through trees on the river's western bank on land donated to Genesee River Wilds, Inc., near Caneadea, NY.  The land is next to NYS Rt. 19 at the site known as the <a href="http://townofcaneadea.org/content/History">"Great Angle."</a>  The name of the "Great Angle" is derived from its location at the point in which the Genesee River turns from an overall northwesterly flow to a primarily northeasterly direction. On the hill behind the eastern bank seen in the distance was a Seneca Indian village with a large council house.  In the 1700s the Council House was frequented by Chief Shongo and reportedly echoed with the voices of famous Senecas such as Red Jacket and Cornplanter.  The trees preserved by Genesee River Wilds at the Great Angle represent a small sample of the plan's goal for restoring historic buffers that once protected the river and its riparian habitat.

The setting later became the High Falls area of downtown Rochester, NY.  The Senecas who dominated the Genesee valley at this time were agriculturalists and harvested timber.  But the intensity was pre-industrial, so it had a less destructive impact on the forests depicted along the river's banks.  The forests provided fish and wildlife habitat, a natural water purification system, and buffers against the flooding, erosion, and sedimentation so apparent in the river as it passes through Rochester today.  Although the full extent of these riparian (streamside) forest buffers can never be restored, appeals to the same economic interests that led to their destruction can generate community support for protecting those that remain and expanding their current size.  This strategy can be implemented on a much greater scale and at far less cost per acre in the rural communities of the upper Genesee River watershed.

              <h4>Approach</h4>

                  <p>
                    The primary strategy for water conservation advocated in this plan is remarkably simple:  Plant trees.  More fully, create permanent buffers of riparian (streamside) forests that restore the Genesee River while protecting it from future development along its edges.  As the section of this plan devoted to this issue indicates, the plan follows the recommendations of the USDA and other agencies in its goals for the minimum widths of forested riparian buffers.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This strategy is much less expensive, more comprehensive in its benefits, and more effective in the long run than strategies emphasizing cement and artificial rock structures.  Applications of such engineering technologies are often necessary emergency measures.  In some cases they are appropriate for other uses.  But they offer little in the way of wildlife habitat or the long-term stability of better zoning practices.  They also can be counter-productive by inadvertently teaching people that the negative consequences of ongoing development up to the water's edge can easily be addressed in the same way in the future.  The resulting spiral in the costs of new problems created by increasing riverside development simply cannot be sustained in the long run.  For these and other reasons, the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> emphasizes the more sustainable practices associated with what is often called a "natural systems approach."
                  </p>

                   <p>
                     More distinctive to this plan is its approach to the challenging problem of how to get people to apply this otherwise simple strategy.

                   </p>

                   <p>
                     The PA DCNR already incorporates this more integrative approach in its own conservation efforts because it combines both conservation and state park management in the same agency.  A statewide greenways initiative begun in PA in the late 1990s has also encouraged much greater collaboration between the PA DCNR and PennDOT.  The distribution of the same responsibilities across three separate agencies in NY (NYSDOT, NYSOPRHP, and NYSDEC) poses greater challenges to such an integrative approach.  However, officials in all three agencies have proven remarkably supportive of the work of the Genesee River Wilds initiative from its very inception.  NYSDEC also has taken steps toward a more integrative approach under the rubric of what is sometimes called "eco-system based management."  No matter what it is called, any approach to conservation of the upper Genesee River that is successful will require appealing to the same broad array of human interests that motivated two centuries of widespread destruction of riparian forests in the first place.
                   </p>

                <h4>Assumptions</h4>

                  <p>
                    The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite>'s limited use of the phrase "watershed management plan" emphasizes the difference between the Genesee River Wilds approach and previous efforts at conservation of the upper Genesee River.  The fundamental assumption in the terminology of "watershed management" is that humans are masters of their environment rather than just a part of it.  This assumption has guided the use and abuse of the Genesee River since Europeans and their descendants began to settle in the river valley in the 1700s.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The Genesee River Wilds initiative operates on a different assumption: It is <em>humans</em>, not the watershed, who need managing.  The Genesee River is impaired because we have not managed <em>ourselves</em> very well.  It is <em>humans</em> who ultimately stripped away the riverside forests that once provided habitat for nesting bald eagles, American river otters, and other wildlife.  Humans removed far too many of the trees that once stablized the Genesee River's banks against erosion; minimized flooding through transpiration of excess water during high water events; provided shade to cool water for fish; barricaded the river against toxic runoff; filtered rain draining through soils into aquifers; fed tiny acquatic life that offered feasts to species higher in the food chain; captured carbon to mitigate climate change; and assured that the Genesee would contribute water of the highest quality to the international treasure of Lake Ontario.  We have no one to blame but <em>ourselves</em> for the impairments that have endangered the safety, health, and quality of life in our own communities from the river's sources all the way downstream to the shores of one of the Great Lakes.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Conservation therefore must be viewed as a <em>human</em> problem rather than merely an environmental problem.  Policies that address this human problem primarily by applying legal force have proven counter-productive in rural communities because such authoritarianism arouses hostility to the very concept of conservation.  The human problem cannot be addressed without a greater role for specialists in anthropology, economics, sociology, and other fields directly focused on humans.  For this reason the biological and environmental science behind many previous approaches to conservation of the Genesee River is rather ironically flawed. Too many conservation efforts pay insufficient attention to the vast history of biological evolution behind what we <em>ourselves</em> as biological creatures bring to conservation. Human evolution generates a variety of behavioral and cognitive tendencies that often make it difficult for us to make scientifically defensible choices in a world more complex than the one in which our Paleolithic ancestors emerged in Africa.  This plan does emphasize education in the natural sciences to promote better practices.  But humans often make foolish choices even when they know better. This plan differs from previous approaches by directing more attention to human obstacles to better choices.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Previous approaches to conservation of the Genesee River also have not appealed to a broad enough array of the motivations that human evolution provides for addressing the problems created by its limitations.  The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> offers incentives for better conservation practices by tapping into a more comprehensive variety of human needs.  These allow us to draw on sources of energy humans normally devote to economic activity, family and communal well-being, physical health, education of children, providing a legacy for future generations, and just having fun.
                  </p>



                    <h4>Scale</h4>
<p>The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is admittedly ambitious in its scale.  Wide buffers, great length, significant acreage, and connectivity reaching for hundreds of miles outside target region. Four reasons: (1) honest assessment of scale of problem.  (2) Need to arouse local support ; (3) need for external funding and political leverage--easier to find money for small things by making them part of big things that address larger numbers and broader range of stakeholders; (4) not so unrealistic given costs of an Abrams tank etc.; support from DCNR; (5) approach chosen matches the scale of the task.
</p>

                  <p>
                    Any approach that is successful on a comprehensive scale also will have to involve entire communities.  Previous efforts have not been able to reverse decades of neglect or provide any significant protections against the construction of riverside housing developments or other rapidly growing threats because they were never even designed to be applied on such a large long-term scale.  If communities can be persuaded to restore to the river more of the wilderness space it once had along its edges, then the missing acres of riparian forests will quickly grow back, the river will heal itself, and these same communities will enjoy more of the untapped potential that better treatment of the river promises.  ----Marshalling this broader array of energy sources offers far more hope for meeting the challenges of restoring riparian (streamside) forest buffers along the Genesee River on an ambitious scale.  --
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> offers precisely this kind of broad-based holistic approach.  Although it may be more ambitious in its conservation goals than other plans, it also applies a strategy big and bold enough to present a more fitting match for the daunting scale of the challenge.
