              <p>
                The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is a "<em>watershed plan</em>." This phrase captures the plan's twin emphases on conservation of a river system and a historically transformative approach. It also expresses the assumptions in this plan better than the common phrase "watershed management plan," which assumes that humans are masters of their environment rather than its dependents.  The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> assumes that impairments in the Genesee River are a <em>human</em> problem caused by our <em>human</em> failure to better "manage" <em>ourselves</em>.  The plan recruits support by directing its initial investments toward economic and other <em>human</em> factors in water conservation.  This is the same approach advocated in the plan's first rudimentary version, which was called <cite>The Genesee River Wilds Project</cite>and appeared in 2008.  The first edition was updated incrementally thereafter, but a thorough revision was overdue.  The changes in this revision are significant enough that it may be treated as a new document.
              </p>

              <p>
                This plan identifies the targeted portion of the Genesee River watershed as the "Genesee River Wilds." This refers to the section of the Genesee river basin from the river's sources at the triple continental divide in Potter County, PA, downstream to the current southern boundary of Letchworth State Park in Portageville, NY.

                  It's all about the trees:  The Genesee River as viewed looking eastward through trees on the river's western bank on land donated to Genesee River Wilds, Inc., near Caneadea, NY.  The land is next to NYS Rt. 19 at the site known as the <a href="http://townofcaneadea.org/content/History">"Great Angle."</a>  The name of the "Great Angle" is derived from its location at the point in which the Genesee River turns from an overall northwesterly flow to a primarily northeasterly direction. On the hill behind the eastern bank seen in the distance was a Seneca Indian village with a large council house.  In the 1700s the Council House was frequented by Chief Shongo and reportedly echoed with the voices of famous Senecas such as Red Jacket and Cornplanter.  The trees preserved by Genesee River Wilds at the Great Angle represent a small sample of the plan's goal for restoring historic buffers that once protected the river.  The forests provided fish and wildlife habitat, a natural water purification system, and buffers against costly flooding, erosion, and sedimentation.  Restoring wide forested riparian (streamside) buffers is far less expensive and far more effective in the long run than other approaches to watershed conservation.

                The phrase "upper Genesee River" is also used to refer to the target area because this phrase is more familiar outside the region.  This refers to the southernmost sections of the Genesee River because the river flows northward.  In this plan the geographical scope of "upper Genesee River" is synonymous with that of "Genesee River Wilds." Both refer only to the sub-basin south of the southern boundary of Letchworth State Park. This contrasts with the common practice of drawing the boundary between the "upper Genesee" and the "lower Genesee" further north at the confluence of the Genesee River and Canaseraga Creek in Mt. Morris, NY.  However, practical considerations often segment out a "middle" section or create a secondary boundary in Portageville. One of the most important recent studies of the "Upper Genesee River Watershed" cited Portageville in this way to limit its own research boundaries to the same portion of the watershed addressed in the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> (Makarewicz, Lewis, Snyder, and Smith 2013 [Vol. 2]). Even NYSDEC and NYSOPRHP reaffirm this tradition in the actual implementation of their own plans because both agencies place their regional administrative boundaries near Portageville.
              </p>

              <h4>Why "Genesee River Wilds"?</h4>

              <p>
                The phrase "Genesee River Wilds" plays multiple roles.  It expresses this plan's goal of restoring the historic corridors of forested <em>wilderness</em> along the Genesee River and its major tributaries. It also epitomizes the plan's strategy.  Interest in restoring this wilderness is promoted through outdoor recreation, which sometimes can be "wild."  The phrase also serves as a marketing tool, which illustrates the plan's concern with eco-tourism. The Genesee River Wilds target area also directly overlaps the magnificent 12-county region of PA known as the Pennsylvania Wilds. This allows "Genesee River Wilds" to represent the sharing of strategies, energy, and resources across the NY/PA state line in the target area.  This partnership has been central to the original plan's approach since the summer of 2008.  The revised version of the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> continues to integrate conservation, recreation, and economic development by promoting the creation of minimally-invasive infrastructure for eco-tourism and other sustainable business on a scale that can only be achieved by collaboration across state lines.
              </p>

              <h4>Approach</h4>

              <p>
                The primary strategy for water conservation advocated in this plan is remarkably simple:  Plant trees.  More fully, create permanent buffers of riparian (streamside) forests that restore the Genesee River while protecting it from future development along its edges.  As the section of this plan devoted to this issue indicates, the plan follows the recommendations of the USDA and other agencies in its goals for the minimum widths of forested riparian buffers.  Instead of trying to tame the river with costly artificial structures that inadvertently encourage even more irresponsible behavior, the emphasis on restoring forested riparian buffers in this plan represents what is often called a "natural systems approach." In contrast to the spiraling costs of building more and more rock and concrete structures to address the new problems created by counter-productive behaviors, this plan's approach is more economically sustainable in the long run.
              </p>

              <p>
                More distinctive to this plan is its approach to the challenging problem of how to get people to apply this otherwise simple strategy.  The thesis of the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is that creating a massive nature park system that extends the benefits of such a system to an equally wide array of stakeholders offers the necessary regional scale and needed variety of incentives.  This is expressed in the plan's broader overall strategy of creating a system of nature parks and green spaces that effectively extends Letchworth State Park to the river's sources in PA one piece at a time.
              </p>

              <h4>Models</h4>

              <p>Previous plans for conservation of the Genesee River have been surprisingly timid about pursuing a model of conservation that stares every planner in the face.  Letchworth State Park in NY is arguably the most successful model for conservation of the Genesee River in the entire watershed.  The emphasis on forestry in the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> finds other models in the watershed in the protective forests around Hemlock and Canadice Lake and the patches of state forest lands around small headwaters streams.  However, Letchworth best illustrates the excitement that can be generated by integrating conservation with outdoor recreation, education, eco-tourism, and other priorities in this plan.  The same strategy has proven successful in many other nature parks, greenways, and other settings that otherwise cannot match the spectacular features of Letchworth.  This plan not only applies such an approach, but also capitalizes on the success of Letchworth by directly tying the Genesee River Wilds into Letchworth itself.</p>

              <p>The connectivity with PA promoted in this plan capitalizes on the potential of integration with a complementary model, which is the spectacular Pine Creek Gorge in PA. Etc.

                Genesee Valley Conservancy shows that it can be done:   Recently celebrated its 25th year by exceeding Letcworth.  The GVC also shows how it's done:   A piece at at time.  Others, SGP River Towns program.  PA Wilds link above etc.  Include videos!

                  <p>
                    Progress: GSG meeting etc.
                  </p>


                    <p>
                      Reason why this is impnt.: It provides resources. etc. shows it can be done.  Big plans require big resources.  One way to secure the necessary leverage is by building big alliances. Since its inception in 2008, the Genesee River Wilds initiative has building numerous alliances across state lines in both NY and PA.  This has resulted in the integration of the relevant features of this plan into appropriate points in other planning documents in both NY and PA.  One illustration of these alliances that is so recent that it is still largely conceptual demonstrates how planning on this scale can lead to even larger alliances that promise more leverage.  This is the GSG.
