                The Genesee River Wilds Approach
            </h3>

            <h4>The Fundamental Role of Forestry</h4>

              <p>
                The primary strategy for water conservation advocated in this plan is remarkably simple: Plant trees. More fully, create permanent buffers of riparian (streamside) forests that restore the Genesee River while protecting it from future development along its edges.  As the section of the Genesee River Wilds Plan devoted to a fuller treatment of this issue indicates, this plan follows the recommendations of scientific studies by the USDA and other agencies in its goals for the minimum widths of forested riparian buffers.
              </p>

              <p>
                This strategy is much less expensive, more comprehensive in its benefits, and more effective in the long run than strategies emphasizing cement and artificial rock structures. Applications of such engineering technologies are often necessary emergency measures. They also provide immediate success in addressing the river's phosphorus and sediment loads. But they offer little in the way of wildlife habitat or the long-term stability of better zoning practices. They also can be counter-productive. Placing too high a priority on riverbank engineering inadvertently teaches people that the negative consequences of irresponsible construction and other riverside development can easily be addressed in the same way in the future. The resulting expansion of riverside land use causes a spiral in costs as additional streambank engineering is required to address the new problems created by this expansion.  This simply cannot be sustained in the long run.  For these and other reasons, the Genesee River Wilds Plan emphasizes tree planting, zoning, and other sustainable practices associated with what is often called a "natural systems approach."

                  <p>
                    It's all about the trees:  The Genesee River as viewed looking eastward through trees on the river's western bank on land donated to Genesee River Wilds, Inc., near Caneadea, NY.  The land is next to NYS Rt. 19 at the site known as the <a href="http://townofcaneadea.org/content/History">"Great Angle."</a>  The name of the "Great Angle" is derived from its location at the point in which the Genesee River turns from an overall northwesterly flow to a primarily northeasterly direction. On the hill behind the eastern bank seen in the distance was a Seneca Indian village with a large council house.  In the 1700s the Council House was frequented by Chief Shongo and reportedly echoed with the voices of famous Senecas such as Red Jacket and Cornplanter.  The trees preserved by Genesee River Wilds at the Great Angle represent a small sample of the plan's goal for restoring historic buffers that once protected the river and its riparian habitat.

                    Painting of the Genesee River by Thomas Davies, "A View of the Casconchiagon or Great Seneca Falls, Lake Ontario, taken 1766." The setting later became the High Falls area of downtown Rochester, NY.  The Senecas who dominated the Genesee valley at this time were agriculturalists and harvested timber.  But the intensity was pre-industrial, so it had a less destructive impact on the forests depicted along the river's banks.  The forests provided fish and wildlife habitat; shade to cool water for fish; food for acquatic life eaten by fish; a natural water purification system; carbon storage to limit climate change; space for natural expansion of the river during high water events to costly flooding; and stabilization of the streambanks against erosion and resulting sedimentation.  The loss of these riparian forests is apparent in the muddied river and lakeshore algae problems in Rochester today.  Although the full extent of these riparian (streamside) forest buffers can never be restored, appeals to the same economic interests that led to their destruction can generate community support for protecting those that remain and expanding their current size.  This strategy can be implemented on a much greater scale and at far less cost per acre in the rural communities of the upper Genesee River watershed.

                <h4>Recruit Support by Integrating Recreational Infrastructure that Addresses Social and Economic Needs</h4>

                    <p>
                      More distinctive to this plan is its approach to the challenging problem of how to get people to apply this otherwise simple strategy. The thesis of the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is that creating a massive nature park system that extends the benefits of such a system to an equally wide array of stakeholders offers the necessary regional scale and needed variety of incentives. This is expressed in the plan's broader overall strategy of creating a system of nature parks and green spaces that effectively extends Letchworth State Park to the river's sources in PA one piece at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The emphasis on forestry in the Genesee River Wilds Plan finds other models in the Genesee watershed in the protective forests around Hemlock Lake, Canadice Lake, and small headwaters streams surrounded by state forest preserves.  However, Letchworth best illustrates the excitement that can be generated by integrating conservation with outdoor recreation, education, eco-tourism, and other priorities in this plan. This approach is itself not new at all.  The same strategy has proven successful in many nature parks, greenways, and other settings that otherwise cannot match the spectacular features of Letchworth. This plan not only applies such an approach, but also capitalizes on the success of Letchworth by directly tying the Genesee River Wilds into Letchworth itself.
                    </p>

                  <h4>Increase Leverage through Alliances and Connectivity</h4>

                     <p>
                       Big plans for big problems require big allies.  So an even more distinctive feature of this plan is its strategy of securing additional political and economic leverage by expanding the range of stakeholders far outside the target area.  One of most collegial avenues has been to increase connectivity downstream to Rochester by transforming the Genesee River into a blueway (water trail for canoes and kayaks) and by increasing basin-wide collaboration on existing multi-use trails such as the Genesee Valley Greenway.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                       From its very inception the Genesee River Wilds has fostered an even larger alliance that is constructing a multi-use trail system from Lake Ontario in Rochester to the Susquehanna River in Williamsport via Letchworth State Park and the spectacular Pine Creek Gorge in PA.  Capitalizing on the triple continental divide to connect the complementary "grand canyons" of Letchworth and Pine Creek promises an economic payoff sufficient to advance progress on the scale needed for conservation of the upper Genesee River.  Even more leverage will be generated by the supplementary plan that emerged in 2014 to integrate this Triple Divide Trail System into the Genesee-Susquehanna Greenway, which will reach over 400 miles from Lake Ontario in Rochester, NY, to Chesapeake Bay in Havre de Grace, MD.
                     </p>


                  <h4>Assumptions</h4>

                    <p>
                      The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> identifies itself as a "watershed plan" while avoiding the longer phrase "watershed management plan."  This is partly to emphasize the difference between the Genesee River Wilds approach and previous efforts at conservation of the upper Genesee River. The fundamental assumption in the terminology of "watershed management" is that humans are masters of their environment rather than just a part of it. This assumption has guided the use and abuse of the Genesee River since Europeans and their descendants began to settle in the river valley in the 1700s.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The Genesee River Wilds initiative operates on a different assumption: It is <em>humans</em>, not the watershed, who need managing.  The Genesee River is impaired because we have not managed <em>ourselves</em> very well.  It is <em>humans</em> who ultimately stripped away the riverside forests that once provided habitat for nesting bald eagles, American river otters, and other wildlife.  Humans removed far too many of the trees that once stablized the Genesee River's banks against erosion; minimized flooding through transpiration of excess water during high water events; provided shade to cool water for fish; barricaded the river against toxic runoff; filtered rain draining through soils into aquifers; fed tiny acquatic life that offered feasts to species higher in the food chain; captured carbon to mitigate climate change; and assured that the Genesee would contribute water of the highest quality to the international treasure of Lake Ontario.  We have no one to blame but <em>ourselves</em> for the impairments that have endangered the safety, health, and quality of life in communities from the river's sources all the way downstream to the shores of one of the Great Lakes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Conservation therefore must be viewed as a <em>human</em> problem rather than merely an environmental problem.  Policies that address this human problem by legal force alone merely arouse hostility to the very concept of conservation.  The human problem cannot be addressed without a greater role for specialists in anthropology, economics, sociology, and other fields directly focused on humans.  For this reason the biological and environmental science behind many previous approaches to conservation of the Genesee River is rather ironically flawed. Too many conservation efforts pay insufficient attention to the vast history of biological evolution behind what we <em>ourselves</em> as biological creatures bring to conservation. Human evolution generates a variety of behavioral and cognitive tendencies that often make it difficult for us to make scientifically defensible choices in a world more complex than the one in which our Paleolithic ancestors emerged in Africa.  This plan does emphasize education in the natural sciences to promote better practices.  But humans often make foolish choices even when they know better. This plan differs from previous approaches by directing more attention to human obstacles to better choices.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Previous approaches to conservation of the Genesee River also have not appealed to a broad enough array of the motivations that human evolution provides.  Potential motivations include some of the same human interests that drove two centuries of widespread destruction of riparian forests in the first place.  The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> offers incentives for better conservation practices by tapping into a more comprehensive variety of human needs.  These allow us to draw on sources of energy humans normally devote to economic activity, family and communal well-being, physical health, education of children, providing a legacy for future generations, and just having fun.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Models</h4>

                    <p>
                      The PA DCNR already incorporates this more integrative approach in its own conservation efforts because it combines both conservation and state park management in the same agency.  A statewide greenways initiative begun in PA in the late 1990s has also encouraged much greater collaboration between the PA DCNR and PennDOT.  The distribution of the same responsibilities across three separate agencies in NY (NYSDOT, NYSOPRHP, and NYSDEC) poses greater challenges to such an integrative approach.  However, officials in all three agencies have proven remarkably supportive of the work of the Genesee River Wilds initiative from its very inception.  NYSDEC also has taken steps toward a more integrative approach under the rubric of what is sometimes called "eco-system based management."
                    </p>

                    <p>Letchworth plus numbers, Pine Creek, etc. plus cost/benefits; D and L Trail like urban connections in Buff/Roch/Syr; SGP River towns; GVC

                    </p>

                      <h4>Scale</h4>
                      <p>The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is admittedly ambitious in its scale.  Wide buffers, great length, significant acreage, and connectivity reaching for hundreds of miles outside target region. Four reasons: (1) honest assessment of scale of problem.  (2) Need to arouse local support ; (3) need for external funding and political leverage--easier to find money for small things by making them part of big things that address larger numbers and broader range of stakeholders; (4) not so unrealistic given costs of an Abrams tank etc.; support from DCNR; (5) approach chosen matches the scale of the task.
                      </p>

                    <p>
                      Any approach that is successful on a comprehensive scale also will have to involve entire communities.  Previous efforts have not been able to reverse decades of neglect or provide any significant protections against the construction of riverside housing developments or other rapidly growing threats because they were never even designed to be applied on such a large long-term scale.  If communities can be persuaded to restore to the river more of the wilderness space it once had along its edges, then the missing acres of riparian forests will quickly grow back, the river will heal itself, and these same communities will enjoy more of the untapped potential that better treatment of the river promises.  ----Marshalling this broader array of energy sources offers far more hope for meeting the challenges of restoring riparian (streamside) forest buffers along the Genesee River on an ambitious scale.  --
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> offers precisely this kind of broad-based holistic approach.  Although it may be more ambitious in its conservation goals than other plans, it also applies a strategy big and bold enough to present a more fitting match for the daunting scale of the challenge.
