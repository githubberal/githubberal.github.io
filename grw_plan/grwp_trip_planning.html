              <p><strong>Plan Your Trip in the Greenway</strong></p>
              <p>The planned greenway from Rochester to Williamsport will connect many finished trails and recreation systems, so many parts of the greenway are already in impeccable condition (especially in and around Rochester, Letchworth State Park, Pine Creek Gorge, and Williamsport).  However, many parts are still under development or only at the planning stages.   For the current status of individual sections, consult special regional organizations for maps and related info.  From north to south, just a few of these include the City of Rochester for the <a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/grt/">Genesee Riverway Trail</a>; the Genesee Transportation Council for a <a href="http://www.gtcmpo.org/Bike_Map/BikeMapInfo.htm">Greater Rochester Area Bicycling Map</a>; the <a href="http://www.geneseewaterways.org/">Genesee Waterways Center</a> for canoes and kayaks on the Genesee River and Erie Canal in Rochester; the <a href="http://www.eriecanalway.org">Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor</a> for the Erie Canal; the <a href="http://www.gvc-adk.org/">Genesee Valley Chapter of the Adirondack Mountain Club</a> for canoeing and kayaking all over the Genesee River watershed; the Friends of the Genesee Valley Greenway for the <a href="http://www.fogvg.org/index.php">Genesee Valley Greenway</a> and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for the <a href="http://nysparks.com/parks/189/details.aspx">Genesee Valley Greenway</a> and <a href="http://nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/79/details.aspx">Letchworth State Park</a>, where whitewater trips are led by <a href="http://www.adventure-calls.com/">Adventure Calls Outfitters</a>; guidebooks for local amenities and specific points of interest for hiking, bicycling, and paddling on the NY side, such as those published by <a href="http://www.footprintpress.com/">Footprint Press</a>; the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation for regulations on its section of the <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/88566.html">WAG Trail</a> (along upper Genesee River from Wellsville, NY, to NY/PA state line); the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources for details on parks such as <a href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/lymanrun">Lyman Run State Park</a> and <a href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/leonardharrison/index.htm">Leonard Harrison State Park</a>; for maps of all PA trails, see <a href="http://www.explorepatrails.com/">ExplorePATrails.com</a>; for details on the Pine Creek Trail, see the <a href="http://www.visittiogapa.com/railtrailmap.pdf">PINE CREEK TRAIL MAP</a> from the Tioga County Visitors Bureau and especially <a href="http://www.pinecreekvalley.com">Pine Creek Valley.com</a>, which includes resources such as <a href="http://www.pinecrk.com/">Pine Creek Outfitters</a>; and for the Williamsport area, the <a href="http://www.vacationpa.com/index.php">Lycoming County Visitor&#8217;s Bureau</a>, the <a href="http://www.ridehiawatha.com">Hiawatha Paddlewheel Riverboat</a> in <a href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/susquehanna/index.htm">Susquehanna State Park</a>, and the <a href="http://www.lyco.org/Home/PlanningandCommunityDevelopment/SusquehannaRiverWalkTimberTrail.aspx">Susquehanna Riverwalk and Timber Trail</a> along the Susquehanna River.  Eventually it will be possible to continue further south from Williamsport along the <a href="http://www.susquehannagreenway.org/">Susquehanna Greenway</a> all the way to the mouth of the Susquehanna River in Chesapeake Bay, where the Susquehanna Greenway intersects with the 3000-mile long bicycle trail known as the <a href="http://www.greenway.org/index.shtml">East Coast Greenway</a>.  This makes the system from Rochester to Williamsport a vital part of a national bicycle interstate system.  Details about other state parks and resources are readily available.  See the <a href="http://www.geneseeriverwilds.org/wp/?page_id=42">links</a> page for additional information.</p>
              <p><strong>Improve the Greenway by Using and Publicizing It </strong></p>
              <p>Using and publicizing the greenway system speeds up progress by helping to recruit volunteers for work on undeveloped sections and making it easier to secure funding.   If you hike, bike, canoe, or kayak the whole trail, please tell others about it.   Let us know so that we can improve the experience.  Obviously some creative portaging and travel in opposite directions is assumed for canoeists and kayakers.</p>
              <p><strong>*Note on name: </strong> Ongoing discussions may lead to minor update of name from previous provisional use of &#8220;Triple Divide  Trail System&#8221; and &#8220;Triple Divide Trail&#8221; to more formal recommendations to use &#8220;<strong>Triple Divide Greenway</strong>&#8221; in the future.  This use of &#8220;greenway&#8221; is more current with naming trends for multi-use trails and watershed conservation corridors. &#8220;Greenway&#8221; will more clearly distinguish this wider corridor from merely a footpath (including one of similar name in MT).  In addition to eliminating a persistent source of confusion, this minor update in the name will also make funding easier.  Current practice in various planning documents in NY and PA uses or implies all three phrases.  However, &#8220;Triple Divide Greenway&#8221; is recommended because it will probably emerge as the preference in future use.  This website will attempt to keep up with any formalized changes. Most recently, this includes the adoption of the name &#8220;Genesee-Susquehanna Greenway&#8221; (map link above) for a larger 400 mile greenway that would incorporate the Triple Divide Trail System.</p>
              <p><strong>**Disclaimer on Maps</strong></p>
              <p>The maps provided in various formats are not complete and may have errors.   Responsibility for usage rests solely with the user.  The maps are limited by their dual function as planning maps and provisional user maps.  The maps do not consistently distinguish the state of the trail or the feasibility of its usage.  As noted above, some sections of the trail are completed and complemented by established park systems.  Other sections may be appropriate for hikers but too rough for bicyclists.  More undeveloped sections may require occasional detours onto nearby roads.  In most of these cases, the maps provide enough detail for users to find their way.   But the creators and distributors of the maps bear no responsibility for anyone getting lost, injured, or in any other way experiencing negative consequences for usage of the maps or trails.  No attempt has been made to identify <strong>hazards</strong>.  In the case of the water trail, this includes rapids and numerous sets of <strong>falls</strong> (especially in the Genesee River in Wellsville, Belmont, Letchworth State Park, and Rochester).  All usage is at your own risk.   Comments, corrections, and updates are appreciated.  See contacts page.</p>
