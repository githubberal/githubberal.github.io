                Economics of the Genesee River Wilds Approach
            </h3>

            <h4>Scale</h4>

            <p>
              One point agreed upon by all concerned with restoring the water quality of the Genesee River and Lake Ontario is that the scale of investment needs to increase. One of the unfortunate consequences is that existing funding channels through federal, state, and county agencies make it tantalizingly easy to merely double down on the same strategies that have been applied with such meager success in the forty years after the 1972 flood. However, the previous chapter showed that the net improvement in the river's water quality over the last forty years was disappointing. This amounts to a basin-wide long-term experiment.  In an era of limited budgetary resources, a more critical assessment of how to get the most benefit from the least cost is crucial to avoiding another forty years of poor investment returns.
            </p>

            <p>
              Any approach that is successful on a comprehensive scale will have to involve entire communities.  Previous efforts have not been able to reverse decades of neglect or provide any significant protections against the construction of riverside housing developments or other rapidly growing threats because they were never even designed to be applied on such a large long-term scale.

                  High falls of the Genesee River in what later became downtown Rochester, in historic painting by Thomas Davies, based on his visit in 1766.  The Senecas who dominated the Genesee valley at this time were agriculturalists and harvested timber.  But the intensity was pre-industrial, so it had a less destructive impact on the forests depicted along the river's banks.  The forests provided fish and wildlife habitat; shade to cool water for fish; food for acquatic life eaten by fish; a natural water purification system; carbon storage to limit climate change; space for natural expansion of the river into the floodplains during high water events; and stabilization of the streambanks against erosion and resulting sedimentation.  The loss of these riparian forests is apparent in the muddied river and lakeshore algae problems in Rochester today. The negative impact on the Rochester city scape has not prevented continued construction of apartment complexes, housing developments, and other development close to the river in the Rochester area.  Although the full extent of historic riparian (streamside) forest buffers can never be restored, appeals to the same economic interests that led to their destruction can generate community support for protecting those that remain and expanding their current size.  This strategy can be implemented on a much greater scale and at far less cost per acre in the rural communities of the upper Genesee River watershed.  Precisely because the soils of the upper Genesee are highly erosive, they demand much more serious investment in restoring historic riparian forests.

                    The limited erosion of the pre-industrial period is evident from the relatively low bank of the Genesee River in this 1856 drawing of the mansion of Philip Church in Belvidere, which is next to the modern crossing of NYS Route 19 and I-86 just north of Belmont, NY.  The drawing is from a map of Allegany County, NY, and reveals a time when the deforestation was still at an early stage.  The impact of the following years of clear cutting and relatively unrestricted building and agriculture in the floodplains is today quite apparent at this site and along the remaining 1600 acres of the historic Church estate downstream. This includes the dramatic erosion of the riverbank and increased frequency of floods large enough to create significant changes in the course of the river's channel.

This shows the scale of the clear cutting of forests further upstream in the triple continental divide headwaters region.  Massive deforestation created great wealth for timber barons in Williamsport, PA, Rochester, NY, and other cities downstream that received logs and lumber transported by canal, river, and rail. It also dramatically increased the frequency and scale of flooding along the three major rivers that begin in the triple divide region (the Genesee River, Susquehanna River [West Branch], and Allegheny River).  The profits of the wealthy thus came at the expense of the many who lost homes and jobs as a result of such flooding.

                    Hiker on Algonquin Mountain in Adirondack Park, NY. Adirondack Park was created in 1892 to protect the water quality and other natural resources in the area against the rapid pace of deforestation that was denuding the forests of the northeastern USA.  New York State continues adding to its "forever wild" forest preserve in the park. Currently this includes NYSDEC's purchase by stages of <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/42077.html">161,000 acres</a>.  The park's six million acres demonstrate that the indisputable role of forests in protecting water quality and providing resources for eco-tourism and other benefits has long been considered an economically productive investment on a breathtaking scale.  The water quality of rivers draining from the Adirondacks into eastern Lake Ontario contrasts sharply with the water quality of the upper Genesee River draining from the more sparsely forested areas of Allegany County into western Lake Ontario.  This is a vivid testimony to a vast disparity in investments.  One of the obvious reasons for this disparity is the fact that the Adironidacks also provide water and recreation for Albany, New York City, and other cities with far more wealthy stakeholders and far more political leverage than the upstream areas of the Genesee River.

                    Fire at Sinclair Oil Refinery next to Genesee River in Wellsville, NY, 1938 (Don Baldwin collection, courtesy Allegany County Historical Society).  At one time the rich oil fields of northwestern PA and southwestern NY represented one of the largest drivers of economic development in the area.  They also were one of the greatest sources of toxic releases into the Genesee River and its tributaries.  Cleanup costs to taxpayers are far more expensive than investment in floodplain zoning and other forms of prevention.  Unfortunately, current investments in strategies that motivate better practices are too meager to prevent the same kind of mistakes from occurring again.  Locals old enough to remember the oil boom are much more likely to appreciate the need for better practices if the same economic concerns that motivated the irresponsible side effects of the oil boom are addressed by conservation strategies that integrate infrastructure for eco-tourism and other business.  Transforming forested buffers into economically productive resources for recreation and eco-tourism also provides an incentive to keep future industrial development further from the Genesee River and its tributaries than in the past.

              <p>
                The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is admittedly ambitious in its scale.  Wide buffers, great length, significant acreage, and connectivity reaching for hundreds of miles outside target region. Four reasons: (1) Honest assessment of scale of problem:  Approach chosen matches the scale of the task. (2) Need to arouse local support.  (3) Need for external funding and political leverage--easier to find money for small things by making them part of big things that address larger numbers and broader range of stakeholders.  (4) Not so unrealistic given costs of other investments by NYSDEC, support from DCNR, EPA, etc.  Much more crucial is to assure that investments are channeled toward strategies that can match the scale of the challenge.  Any that meet this criterion will have to marshal a broader array of energy sources than those addressed by agency funding channels directed at farmers, emergencies, and other targets over the last few decades.
              </p>


              <h4>The Budgetary Priority of Forestry</h4>

                <p>
                  The primary strategy for water conservation advocated in this plan is remarkably simple: Plant trees. More fully, expand the width of permanent buffers of riparian (streamside) forests that restore the Genesee River while protecting it from future development along its edges.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This strategy is much less expensive and addresses a wider array of benefits than strategies emphasizing cement and artificial rock structures. Applications of such engineering technologies are often necessary emergency measures for stabilizing eroding streambanks near homes and infrastructure.  They also can provide measureable benefits in reducing phosphorus and sediment loads at problem sites.  They can also provide time for new riverside forests to be established at such sites.
                </p>

                  <p>
                    However, the long-term affects of human behaviors are rarely factored into quantitative estimates of the costs and benefits of streambank engineering projects.  Placing too high a priority on such approaches may inadvertently teach people that the negative consequences of irresponsible activities in the floodplain can easily be addressed in the same way in the future. The resulting expansion of riverside development can cause a spiral in costs as additional streambank engineering is required to address the new problems created by this expansion.  This process simply cannot be sustained.  Even funding the ongoing maintenance of Mt. Morris Dam alone is proving to be a budgetary challenge.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    An additional problem with costly streambank projects funded by taxpayers is that they are frequently designed to help a relatively small handful of landowners. Often they are also designed with little concern for wildlife habitat, public recreation, eco-tourism, and other benefits that might have been addressed at the same time and at the same cost. For these and other reasons, the Genesee River Wilds Plan emphasizes tree planting, floodplain zoning for forestry, and other sustainable practices associated with what is often called a "natural systems approach."
                  </p>

                <h4>Recruit Support by Integrating Recreational Infrastructure that Addresses Social and Economic Needs</h4>

                    <p>
                      More distinctive to this plan is its approach to the challenging problem of how to get people to apply this otherwise simple strategy. The thesis of the <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> is that creating a massive nature park system that extends the benefits of such a system to an equally wide array of stakeholders offers the necessary regional scale and needed variety of incentives. This is expressed in the plan's broader overall strategy of creating a system of nature parks and green spaces that effectively extends Letchworth State Park to the river's sources in PA one piece at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The emphasis on forestry in the Genesee River Wilds Plan finds other models in the Genesee watershed in the protective forests around Hemlock Lake, Canadice Lake, and small headwaters streams surrounded by state forest preserves.  However, Letchworth best illustrates the excitement that can be generated by integrating conservation with outdoor recreation, education, eco-tourism, and other priorities in this plan. This approach is itself not new at all.  The same strategy has proven successful in many nature parks, greenways, and other settings that otherwise cannot match the spectacular features of Letchworth. This plan not only applies such an approach, but also capitalizes on the success of Letchworth by directly tying the Genesee River Wilds into Letchworth itself.
                    </p>

                  <h4>Increase Leverage through Alliances and Connectivity</h4>

                     <p>
                       Big plans for big problems require big allies.  So an even more distinctive feature of this plan is its strategy of securing additional political and economic leverage by expanding the range of stakeholders far outside the target area.  One of most collegial avenues has been to increase connectivity downstream to Rochester by transforming the Genesee River into a blueway (water trail for canoes and kayaks) and by increasing basin-wide collaboration on existing multi-use trails such as the Genesee Valley Greenway.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                       From its very inception the Genesee River Wilds has fostered an even larger alliance that is constructing a multi-use trail system from Lake Ontario in Rochester to the Susquehanna River in Williamsport via Letchworth State Park and the spectacular Pine Creek Gorge in PA.  Capitalizing on the triple continental divide to connect the complementary "grand canyons" of Letchworth and Pine Creek promises an economic payoff sufficient to advance progress on the scale needed for conservation of the upper Genesee River.  Even more leverage will be generated by the supplementary plan that emerged in 2014 to integrate this Triple Divide Trail System into the Genesee-Susquehanna Greenway, which will reach over 400 miles from Lake Ontario in Rochester, NY, to Chesapeake Bay in Havre de Grace, MD.
                     </p>


                  <h4>Assumptions</h4>

                    <p>
                      The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> identifies itself as a "watershed plan" while avoiding the longer phrase "watershed management plan." This is partly because the terminology of "watershed management" implies that humans are masters of their environment rather than just a part of it. This assumption has guided the use and abuse of the Genesee River since Europeans and their descendants began to settle in the river valley in the 1700s.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The Genesee River Wilds initiative operates on different assumptions.  Although the present features of the Genesee River are geologically rather young, the river apparently thrived for a long time before recent efforts to manage it.  It is <em>humans</em>, not the watershed, who need managing.  The Genesee River is impaired because we have not managed <em>ourselves</em> very well.  It is <em>humans</em> who removed far too many of the trees that once provided wildlife habitat, stablized the riverbanks against erosion, reduced flooding, barricaded against toxic runoff, and filtered rain draining through soils into aquifers.  We have no one to blame but <em>ourselves</em> for the impairments that have endangered the safety, health, and quality of life in communities from the river's sources all the way downstream to the shores of one of the Great Lakes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Conservation therefore must be viewed as a <em>human</em> problem rather than merely an environmental problem.  Policies that address this human problem by legal force alone merely arouse hostility to the very concept of conservation.  The human problem cannot be addressed without a greater role for specialists in anthropology, economics, sociology, and other fields directly focused on humans.  For this reason the biological and environmental science behind many previous approaches to conservation of the Genesee River is rather ironically flawed. Too many conservation efforts pay insufficient attention to the vast history of biological evolution behind what we <em>ourselves</em> as biological creatures bring to conservation. Human evolution generates a variety of behavioral and cognitive tendencies that often make it difficult for us to make scientifically defensible choices in a world more complex than the one in which our Paleolithic ancestors emerged in Africa.  This plan does emphasize education in the natural sciences to promote better practices.  But humans often make foolish choices even when they know better. This plan differs from previous approaches by directing more attention to human obstacles to better choices.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Previous approaches to conservation of the Genesee River also have not appealed to a broad enough array of the motivations that human evolution provides.  Potential motivations include some of the same human interests that drove two centuries of widespread destruction of riparian forests in the first place.  The <cite>Genesee River Wilds Plan</cite> offers incentives for better conservation practices by tapping into a more comprehensive variety of human needs.  These allow us to draw on sources of energy humans normally devote to economic activity, family and communal well-being, physical health, education of children, providing a legacy for future generations, and just having fun.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Models</h4>

                    <p>
                      The PA DCNR already incorporates this more integrative approach in its own conservation efforts because it combines both conservation and state park management in the same agency.  A statewide greenways initiative begun in PA in the late 1990s has also encouraged much greater collaboration between the PA DCNR and PennDOT.  The distribution of the same responsibilities across three separate agencies in NY (NYSDOT, NYSOPRHP, and NYSDEC) poses greater challenges to such an integrative approach.  However, officials in all three agencies have proven remarkably supportive of the work of the Genesee River Wilds initiative from its very inception.  NYSDEC also has taken steps toward a more integrative approach under the rubric of what is sometimes called "eco-system based management."
